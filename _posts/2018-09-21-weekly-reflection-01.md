This class is probably one of my favorite classes ever. It is so fun to work on my own webpage. In this past week, I have learned how to create folders and put certain files into them. I also learned how to change the font and background of my webpage. Everything was a challenge, but then I learned how to over come it. This is the end of my first blog, stay tuned for the next!
