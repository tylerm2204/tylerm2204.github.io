This week in computer science, we learned a lot of stuff. IÂ´m starting to like computer science a lot that it is my favorite subject. Things that we learned this week include css colours and palettes. These are basically the colours you can use to style your page by using a hashtag and a code of numbers and/or letters that corresponds to the colour you want to use. For example #FFFFF gives you black. Also we learned about different tags used in coding. One tag that I learned about is "em". "em" is used to make words italicized. One last thing we learned about this week is contracts in coding. Contracts in coding is somewhat similar to contracts in sports and jobs. In cs, a contract is when you give the computer what it expects, and the computer gives back what you expect. A challenge I am having in computer science is coding on github without any help. I will figure it out soon by studying at home. This is the end of the blog, so stay tuned for the next one!
