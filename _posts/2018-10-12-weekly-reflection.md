#_part 1_
This week in computter science, we learned some new stuff. One thing we did is Pair Programming. This is when we pair up with a partner
and take turns doing problems in wescheme. Only one person can control the keyboard and mouse, while the other person has to tell them what to do. By doing this, we learned how to use (put-image) in weshceme. Put-image is a function used to put an image or shape inside another image or shape. You would usually see this in racket, the format of coding used in wescheme. To use put-image, the contract would look like this: (put-image (square 30 "solid" "blue") 25 10 (circle 15 "solid" "red")).

I can connect this to week 2 where I learned how to solve equations in wescheme. To solve a math equation, the contract would look like this: (- ( + 4 12) 9). This is similar to how you use put-image because you have to put in a function, in this case put-image. After that, you put in another pair of parenthesis and another set of functions. Then you put the last pair of functions at the end to get an image like this:

With the math, you get the answer to the equation.

In class, I believe that I contribute enough. Sometimes but not all the time, I will raise my hand to answer a question that Mr. Allata asks. I would complete my notes and keep a good track of what we learned. Also, I may finish early and can work on something else.

Some struggles I have in class is figuring out how to put more than 2 shapes into each other. Also I am having trouble with finding the correct names of shapes in wescheme. An accomplishment I have made was finishing my flag on wescheme and in the real world.
