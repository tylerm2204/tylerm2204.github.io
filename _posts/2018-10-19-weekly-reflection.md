This week in Computer Science, we did our flag project. Basically, what we did was use functions that we learned
from past weeks to create a national flag. One function I used was overlay. This function allows you to put 
multiple images and shapes together. Also while doing this, we had to create an original program. Instead getting
help or a template, we had to create a new program on wescheme from scratch. Most of it was pretty easy. However,
A challenging part in this was being able to define a function. I am slowely figuring out how to define a function.
Once I get that figured out, I will be good for a while. One opportunity or thing I learned is that when using 
overlay, I found out that I can put multiple star outlines that are each a little bit bigger than eachother. By
doing this, I made a more thicker outline star instead of a thin outline that I could barely see.
