So, it is the end of the first benchmark period. We have learned a lot of things in computer science so far. I finally figured out how to apply a definition to my expression. I also completed my flag project. If you didn't know what my flag was, it was the moroccan flag. So, here is the whole summary of the benchmark.

#_Week 1_ 
In the first week of Computer Science, I learned how to create files on github. I also learned how to change the font and background of my page. We just started during this week so i didn't know that much. Before this week, I really didn't know what an HTML was. I didn't know what css was too. However, Mr. Allata taught us what it meant. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. These 2 programming languages are used to create and style a page.

#_Week 2_
During this week, we played ninja cat. It was a buggy game but fun too. After that, wee had to figure out the coordinates of the drwaing Mr. Allata made in class. The coordinates of the image was 87.5. Then, we had to figure out the coordinates of the dog in the ninja cat game. We found that the dog moves from right to left. The X value decreases as it come towards the left side of the screen. When the dog is destroyed, it respawns on the right side automatically.
