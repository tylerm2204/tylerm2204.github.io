So, it is the end of the first benchmark period. We have learned a lot of things in computer science so far. I finally figured out how to apply a definition to my expression. I also completed my flag project. If you didn't know what my flag was, it was the moroccan flag. So, here is the whole summary of the benchmark.

#_Week 1_ 
In the first week of Computer Science, I learned how to create files on github. I also learned how to change the font and background of my page. We just started during this week so i didn't know that much. Before this week, I really didn't know what an HTML was. I didn't know what css was too. However, Mr. Allata taught us what it meant. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. These 2 programming languages are used to create and style a page. I can connect this to my Github page because I use HTML and CSS to style it.

#_Week 2_
During the second week, we played ninja cat. It was a buggy game but fun too. After that, wee had to figure out the coordinates of the drwaing Mr. Allata made in class. The coordinates of the image was 87.5. Then, we had to figure out the coordinates of the dog in the ninja cat game. We found that the dog moves from right to left. The X value decreases as it come towards the left side of the screen. When the dog is destroyed, it respawns on the right side automatically. This week, we also learned about circles of evaluation. This is when you apply an expression in a certain order, and it evaluates it. I can connect this to math because in math, to get a certain answer, you have to put the expression in a certain order. For example, in math if you write the equation 4 x (5 + 7), you get 48. In CS, if you write (* (- 8 12) 4), you get -16. The only way the expression will be evaluated is if you write it correctly.

#_Week 3_
In the third week in computer science, we learned a lot of stuff. Things that we learned this week include css colours and palettes. These are basically the colours you can use to style your page by using a hashtag and a code of numbers and/or letters that corresponds to the colour you want to use. For example #000000 gives you black. Also we learned about different tags used in coding. One tag I learned about is <"li">. <"li"> is used to make a dotted or numbered list. One last thing we learned about this week is contracts in coding. Contracts in coding is somewhat similar to contracts in sports and jobs. In CS, a contract is when you give the computer what it expects, and the computer gives back what you expect. 

#_Week 4_
In the fourth week, we did Pair Programming. This is when you pair up with a partner on one computer. The person on the left side of the computer has to tell the person on the right side what to do without touching the mouse or keyboard. We did this to create a put image of different shapes. After one argument, we would give each other a high five and switch roles. An example of an argument would be this:
(put-image (star 30 "solid" "red") 5 20 (square 40 “solid” “blue”)). I can connect this to week 2 where I learned how to solve equations in wescheme. This is similar because in both of these, you have to apply an order to evaluate an expression.

#_Week 5_
Technically being the last week before the end of the benchmark, I finally started my flag project. I took the skills that I learned from week 4 (connection), and made the moroccan flag. Instead of using put-image, I used another function called overlay. What it does is that it can overlay multiple shapes on to each other, this way I don't have to define multiple put-images. Also, we had to make an original program. Instead of having a template or any help, we had to start the project from the beginning. It was pretty easy at first. The only trouble I had was defining an argument. In week 6 though, I figured out how to use a define.

We learned a lot of things this benchmark, but I know we are going to learn way much more in the next one. I will have some challenges that I will overcome next benchmark too. 

-This is the end of the blog, See you in the next one!-
