This is an early learning blog because this week is thanksgiving. What we learned today is how to screenshot an image from another url. In wescheme, we took multiple images from other url's to make one picture. We also learned about scaling. Scaling is when you multiply the size of an image by any number. For example, if the scale is 2, then the image would grow twice as big as it was. Here is an example of a scaled image:

(scale 2(bitmap/url "https://emojipedia-us.s3.dualstack.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/socialmedia/samsung/46/slice-of-pizza_1f355.png"))
-If this doesn't work I will try to fix it-

That is it for this week.
