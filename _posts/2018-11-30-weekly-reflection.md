This week in CS, we took a midterm test to see how much we learned so far. The mastery skills we tested on were MS1, which is using tools, MS3, which is applying tools, and MS5, which is comparing functions to real life situations. An example of one of the questions is question 13, here it is:
```
Choose the contract of the function that would solve the following problem.

Design a function that takes in the color of a circle and produces a small dot of the given radius.
(a) ;dot: String -> Image
(b) ;dot: Number -> String
(c) ;dot: Number -> Image
(d) (dot "green")
``` 
The answer to the question is (a). This question was an apprentice in difficulty, meaning we've seen this type of question before.on 52% of people got this correct. This question is good because it test our skill to see if we can remember what the correct way to write that function is.
