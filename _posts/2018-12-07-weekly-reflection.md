This week in CS, we started the Flag Project v2.0. The Flag that I was assigned was the Malaysian Flag. It is a nice flag. To me it looks a lot like the american flag. The geometry of the flag has many stripes and rectangles. It also has a cresent and a 14 point star on the top right corner. It will be pretty hard since I don't know how to make a 14-point star in wescheme. However, I did start to work on my flag project in wescheme.
