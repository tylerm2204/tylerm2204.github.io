## Flag of _Malaysia_ by _Tyler Marx_

## Describe your program

The country I designed for was Malaysia. I is a pretty hard flag to make, but in the end it will look cool. I expect to hopefully get a professional grade because this flag was advanced and I worked hard on it a put every detail into it.

## Current output

## Describe your process.

The process was really hard to create the Malaysian flag. The first challenge I had was creating the star. The star has 14 points on it. However, I looked up how to do it, and I figures it out. You have to input 3 numbers for your star. The first number is the number of points. The second number is the radius of the middle. The last number is the size of the whole star. Another problem I had was creating the stripes for the flag. With help from Steven and Benjamin, I figured out how to do it by using definitions.


## Explain your code.

-   Choose a significant part of your program (15 lines max) and paste it below. Do not insert your entire program here. _then delete this instruction_
-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_
The arguments in the box are the most important in my whole code. The definitions leading up to the final falg are what really helped instead of rewriting the code over and over again. It function

```
(define BIG (rectangle WITH HIGHT "solid" "darkblue"))
(define JUICE (circle 40 "solid" "gold"))
(define BOB (circle 30 "solid" "darkblue"))
(define CRESCENT (put-image BOB 55 42 JUICE))
(define TOGETHER (put-image BIG 70 150 BOX))
(define YEET (put-image CRESCENT 46 150 TOGETHER))
(define YUSS (put-image STAR 105 150 YEET))
(define OK (put-image STRIPES 150 7 YUSS))
(define OMG (put-image STRIPES 150 35 OK))
(define OOF (put-image STRIPES 150 63 OMG))
(define GOOD (put-image STRIPES 150 91 OOF))
(define DOG (put-image STRIPE 225 119 GOOD))
(define CAT (put-image STRIPE 225 147 DOG))
(define HOORAY (put-image STRIPE 225 175 CAT))
HOORAY
```

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.
